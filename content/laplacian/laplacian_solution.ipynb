    "Besides ensuring the error norms L1, L2 and L infinity are small (they should all be well below 0.1), you can also have a look at the test function and its Laplacian by executing `checker.py laplacian`. You are free to also look at the `divergence` or `curl` computed above, by using `checker.py divergence` and `checker.py curl`. However, those are the same as the ones computed in the last exercise. You will notice that the **error for the Laplacian is a lot worse** than for the other differentials. We will address this in the next exercise. "
