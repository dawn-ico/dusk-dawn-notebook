    "### Jupyter Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Lab gives us a convenient environment to work with notebooks. The current web interface is Jupyter Lab. It has some very nice features that we want to go through:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### File Explorer\n",
    "\n",
    "On the left hand side you will find a simple file explorer with the following useful functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can navigate between folders by double clicking folders. At the top, you will see the current path and you can navigate back to the starting location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Double clicking a file will open it. Depending on the file type it will be opened differently. Jupyter Lab also has a basic text editor, so you can open textual files.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is likely that you opened jupyter lab through mybinder or by running a docker image. In that case, it's useful to download files onto your local machine. You can do that by right clicking a file and then selecting download. Vice versa, you can also upload files by clicking the upload file button (up arrow icon) at the top button toolbar of the file explorer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file explorer is quite useful and you're generally encouraged to look for features yourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Launcher\n",
    "\n",
    "The next feature we want to look at is the launcher. It is accessible through the file explorere. The plus icon at the top toolbar of the file explorer will open the launcher. With the launcher you can start new python notebooks, python consoles and even a basic terminal. This way you can, e.g., experiment with dusk & dawn more interactively by using a python console or a terminal. Additionally, you can create your own python notebooks for experimentation and if you want, you can also download it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Windowing\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter lab has pretty good support for having different _windows_ open. If you open multiple notebooks, terminals or consoles, they will all be accessible from the top bar. Almost at the top of this web interface. By dragging the window title, you can arrange the windows however you want. E.g., side by side or top/down arrangements are possible as well. You are also encouraged to arrange them to your liking. Some useful layouts could be to open an exercise notebook side by side with the corresponding exercise slides or to have a python console below your exercise notebook, to experiment with dusk/dawn's functionality while solving the exercise."
